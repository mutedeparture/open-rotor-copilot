## What is this?

**Open Rotor Copilot AI** is an open-source LLM-driven project focused on interpreting drone telemetry, assisting with diagnostics, and providing actionable insights for both pilots and developers.

- Flight Log Analysis: Input drone logs (Betaflight Blackbox and similar), receive instant, natural language feedback on issues and flight performance.

- Feature-rich: Supports a wide set of aggregated features including gyro statistics, RC command metrics, voltage behavior, motor outputs, GPS, RSSI, accelerometer patterns, and more.

- Windowed Reasoning: Breaks logs into time windows, analyzes events in context, and describes conditions using human-friendly language.

- Compositional Explanations: For each window, outputs a concise, context-aware reason describing any detected issue or anomaly.

- Flexible, Extensible: Built for integration into other open drone ecosystems or research workflows.

## How It Works

This module takes **structured telemetry** (parsed from `.bbl` logs) and feeds it into a **locally trained LLM** to detect flight issues. For each segment, receive an explanation such as:

```bash
"Excessive vibration (gyro_std=123.56); Battery voltage sagged (vbat_drop=0.91V); Motor difference high (motor_diff_max=49.18)"
```

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è Compatible with Drone Logs: Parses and processes logs from real flights or simulations

- üß† LLM-Friendly Inputs: Each window formatted as a descriptive string‚Äîready for Hugging Face and other ML frameworks

- üí¨ Human-Centric Reasons: Outputs are concise and helpful, designed for pilots, engineers, and AI systems alike

- üî¨ Advanced Feature Set: See below for the full list!

- ü§ó Hugging Face Ready: Designed for easy use with Hugging Face datasets and transformers

## Issues Detected & Explained

Open Rotor Copilot is designed to detect and explain the following common multirotor (FPV/drone) flight issues from Blackbox log data:

| **Issue Name**           | **Short Description**                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **prop\_wash**           | Excessive prop wash, usually at high throttle         |
| **motor\_desync**        | Motor outputs diverge due to electrical desync        |
| **motor\_stall**         | Motor output too low for sustained period             |
| **flip**                 | Sudden/unnatural roll or pitch flip detected          |
| **excessive\_vibration** | Gyro sensor sees abnormal vibration                   |
| **pid\_saturation**      | PID loop output saturates, can‚Äôt stabilize craft      |
| **mixer\_saturation**    | Mixer hits max/min output, control authority loss     |
| **frame\_resonance**     | Frame or propeller mechanical resonance in gyro data  |
| **prop\_damage**         | Motor output imbalance hints at damaged prop(s)       |
| **attitude\_change**     | Rapid orientation/attitude change detected            |
| **battery\_sag**         | Battery voltage drops under high load                 |
| **brownout**             | Voltage drops dangerously low, risking shutdown       |
| **current\_draw**        | Excessive current draw detected                       |
| **rssi\_drop**           | Radio link signal drops below safe levels             |
| **rc\_loss**             | RC (remote control) link lost or fails                |
| **rc\_jitter**           | Sudden/unusual RC input changes (spikes, noise)       |
| **gps\_loss**            | GPS satellite loss or outage detected                 |
| **accel\_drift**         | Acceleration sensor drifts from normal expected value |
| **alt\_sensor**          | Sudden/erratic baro/GPS altitude readings             |
| **heading\_jump**        | Heading (compass/yaw) sudden/unexpected jump          |
| **crash**                | Sudden impact or motor drop indicating possible crash |
| **no\_issue**            | No anomaly or problem detected                        |


## Inference

```bash
pip install datasets transformers
```

### Using Fine-tune the Model

```python
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="rbarac/open-rotor-copilot")

test_input = "avg gyro_std = 32.8, motors_min = 15.8, vbat_drop = 0.91, ... (all your features)"
prompt = f"Flight log: {test_input}\nExplain:"

result = pipe(prompt)
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```
